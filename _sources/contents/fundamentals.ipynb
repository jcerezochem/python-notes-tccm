    "# Python Fundamentals\n",
    "In this chapter, we will introduce you to the very basics\n",
    "of computer programming with Python. We will first see\n",
    "some general notions that will make you understand how a Python \n",
    "program looks. Then we will go through how to \n",
    "write basic instructions for reading and writing\n",
    "inside a computer program. We will also explain the types\n",
    "of variables we can use. Finally we will introduce\n",
    "the basics of writing functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python is a **high-level programming language**,\n",
    "like others you may have heard about, including\n",
    "Fortran, C or C++. High-level\n",
    "languages differ from low-level languages in that\n",
    "the former can be easily understood by people, while\n",
    "the latter are those that can be understood by machines. \n",
    "So when writing in a high-level language we normally\n",
    "need to translate the actions in our code to \n",
    "machine-readable format.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever done any programming before using \n",
    "languages like Fortran, C or C++, you surely adopted\n",
    "a workflow where you first wrote code and then \n",
    "compiled using another program called **compiler**.\n",
    "That will not be the case with Python. One of the\n",
    "key differences between Python and those other programming\n",
    "languages is that Python is an **interpretive** language.\n",
    "Hence you will not have to compile the code as you\n",
    "modify it. The **Python interpreter** performs those \n",
    "actions for you. But this comes with a caveat. \n",
    "Because Python is not compiled, your\n",
    "programs written in Python will not be as fast as they \n",
    "could be when written in Fortran or C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in practice, writing our first\n",
    "program in Python. In your terminal, open a text editor\n",
    "and write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "# Our fisrt Python program\n",
    "print (\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "You will notice that the first couple of lines start with \n",
    "a hash symbol (#). This means that whatever follows will\n",
    "not be read by the Python interpreter and is what we \n",
    "usually regard as a **comment**.\n",
    "Now close the file, save it as `hello_world.py` and run \n",
    "the following command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python hello_world.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now check whether the program has done as you intended it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Names and cases\n",
    "In your programs you will usually be defining lots of different\n",
    "variables. One of the things you must remember is that Python\n",
    "is **case sensitive**, so when you try"

    "things do not go well. Python returns an error (specifically, \n",
    "a `NameError`), as a variable named `A` does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is convenient to choose **variable names** that\n",
    "will be meaningful to you and any other potential user of your\n",
    "program (often your future self). For example, if you are\n",
    "calculating the area of a circle, it would make sense to\n",
    "write something like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "area = pi*radius**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we are using some stuff that you we have not covered yet.\n",
    "Also, we are assuming that you have given values to both `pi`\n",
    "and `radius`. \n",
    "But you surely understand why we are using the code snippet as\n",
    "an example of using meaningful variable names. Using cryptic \n",
    "variable names will make everyone miserable, so it is a good \n",
    "investment to use names that seem sensible choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in Python some possibilities are forbidden, like\n",
    "starting a variable with a number. If you write code including \n",
    "something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "77david = 'myname'\n",
    "```\n",
    "and try to run it, you will get a `SyntaxError`. The same thing \n",
    "will happen if you try to use one of the many keywords in\n",
    "Python. These include\n",
    "```\n",
    "and     del     from        not     while\n",
    "as      elif    global      or      with\n",
    "assert  else    if          pass    yield\n",
    "break   except  import      print   class\n",
    "in      raise   continue    is      return\n",
    "def     for     lambda      try\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in Python there are naming conventions\n",
    "that you should follow. These are described in\n",
    "[PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#prescriptive-naming-conventions).\n",
    "For example, variables are typically written in lowercase, \n",
    "and so are functions. On the other hand, classes, which \n",
    "we will learn about in the future, use the so-called\n",
    "CapWords style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input / Output\t\n",
    "In our first program `hello_world.py` above, we have already \n",
    "written to something we call the \"standard output\", i.e. the \n",
    "display, using the `print` function. \n",
    "In Python there are many different ways to read input \n",
    "into a program and to write your output. You can, for example,\n",
    "prompt the user to write a set of input variables using the \n",
    "keyword for the program to read (this would be the \"standard \n",
    "input\") or make the program write the results of a calculation\n",
    "to a file. Here we explore the basics of Input / Output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening and closing files\n",
    "Suppose that there is a file called `myfile.txt` from which you \n",
    "want to read some contents. In order to do that, you will have to\n",
    "write \n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this statement, we are using a **built-in function** called `open`.\n",
    "The first argument of this function is the external filename (Python\n",
    "will assume that the file does exist). The second argument indicates \n",
    "the processing **mode**. There are different modes available:\n",
    "* `r`: read only mode\n",
    "* `w`: write only mode\n",
    "* `a`: append mode\n",
    "* `r+`: read and write mode\n",
    "*  `t`: text mode\n",
    "* `b`: binary mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of data in the file and what you intend to use \n",
    "the file for, you will choose one of these ways of opening the file. \n",
    "As a good programming habbit, remember to close files once you no \n",
    "longer need to access them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Another way of opening files in Python is using **file iterators**.\n",
    "You are using them when you open files using the \n",
    "`with` statement, which works as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"myfile.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case you do not need to close the file yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading and writing data into files \n",
    "Once you have opened a file, you will many times want to read its \n",
    "contents. You can do that line by line for the `myfile.txt` which \n",
    "you have opened and named as `f` in your program doing\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.readline()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can bulk-read all the file using `readlines()` instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you want to write into your file, you would be\n",
    "able to do the following\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f.write(\"hello world!\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "where we are simply writing a text string. As we go along, we\n",
    "will greatly expand our understanding of Input/Output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "Variables in Python can be of many different types,\n",
    "including text strings, lists, integers, floats and\n",
    "Boolean. An highly consequential thing we must say, \n",
    "but we will not fully explain yet, is that in Python\n",
    "variables take the form of **objects**, which are the\n",
    "most fundamental notion in Python programming. For now,\n",
    "we will just say that objects are *pieces of memory, \n",
    "with values and sets of associated operations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment of a value to a variable\n",
    "is simply made using the equal operator \n",
    "(`=`) in statements like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because Python has **dynamic typing**, you do not \n",
    "have to declare variables. Python will assign\n",
    "a type to each variable in your code. In order\n",
    "to know the type of a given variable, you can use\n",
    "the intrinsic function `type`."
