    "## A note on indentation\n",
    "In Python, the way that a program looks is \n",
    "very much determined by indentation. This \n",
    "differs from what we will find in other languages\n",
    "like Fortran or C, where formatting is not so\n",
    "important. In this chapter we will use indentation\n",
    "exhaustively, because as you will see it is essential\n",
    "for flow control. \n",
    "When you write an `if` statement in\n",
    "Python, you must respect the right indentation,\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x < 12:\n",
    "    print (x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "And if not, the code will simply not run. \n",
    "Different levels of indentation start where \n",
    "we have colons (`:`), and these have to be \n",
    "indented with respect to the previous level\n",
    "of indentation. Be \n",
    "careful not to add white spaces where they do not\n",
    "belong and use consistently tabs or spaces\n",
    "(4 spaces is the preferred option in \n",
    "[PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#indentation)). \n",
    "This may feel like a nuisance if you have\n",
    "experience in some other programming language, but\n",
    "will help orient yourself when reading code in the\n",
    "long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditionals (if)\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we want to execute a piece of code\n",
    "depending on the results of one or more conditions (which we will call logical tests).\n",
    "This is actually one of the main control flow structures in Python (and most\n",
    "programming languages). The basic syntax in Python is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition1:\n",
    "    # A number of actions that take place if condition1 is True\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "elif condition2:\n",
    "    # A number of actions that take place if condition2 is True\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # A number of actions that take place if none of the above is True\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical tests and conditional operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, some words on logical tests and conditional operators are in order.\n",
    "Logical tests are expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False` \n",
    "and correspond to variables of type `bool` (Booleans, as seen in the \n",
    "[previous chapter](fundamentals.md)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical tests are built using conditional operators. \n",
    "The most common ones are `==` (equal), `!=` (not equal), `>` (greater than), \n",
    "`<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to).\n",
    "As you would expect, these comparison operators give the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 == 2 # False\n",
    "1 != 2 # True\n",
    "1 < 2 # True\n",
    "1 > 2 # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "There is another operator, `is`, that is similar to `==` but checks if two variables\n",
    "are the same **object** (point to the same address in memory). \n",
    "In general, for two different variables with the same value, this operator evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "For instance, if we compare two different float variables with the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1.0\n",
    "y = 1.0\n",
    "x == y # True\n",
    "x is y # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not always the case for integers, because Python caches the most commonly used\n",
    "integers, so that they are the same object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 1\n",
    "y = 1\n",
    "x == y # True\n",
    "x is y # True\n",
    "\n",
    "# But with larger integers this is not the case:\n",
    "x = 1554223641\n",
    "y = 1554223641\n",
    "x == y # True\n",
    "x is y # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, we use `==` to compare values (i.e., what we normally intend to do) and `is` to compare objects.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful operator is `in`, which checks if a value is contained in a list,\n",
    "tuple or dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 in [1, 2, 3] # True\n",
    "1 in [2, 3, 4] # False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical tests can be combined using the logical operators `and`, `or` and `not`. \n",
    "They work as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "True and False # False\n",
    "True or False # True\n",
    "not True # False\n",
    "not False # True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also worth mentioning that some non-boolean values can be evaluated\n",
    "as `True` or `False`. For instance, the number `0` is evaluated as `False`, while\n",
    "any other number is evaluated as `True`. Similarly, the empty string `\"\"` is evaluated\n",
    "as `False`, while any other string is evaluated as `True`. An empty list also evaluates\n",
    "as `False`, while any other list evaluates as `True`.\n",
    "Such equivalences can be made explicit using the `bool` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bool(0) # False\n",
    "bool(1) # True\n",
    "bool(\"\") # False\n",
    "bool(\"Hello\") # True\n",
    "bool([]) # False\n",
    "bool([1, 2, 3]) # True\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Loops (for while)\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## \tIterators and generators\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## \tComprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and dictionaries can be created in a very compact way using comprehensions.\n",
    "The list is created based on another list, dictionary or iterable object, and\n",
    "a condition can be added to filter the elements that are included in the new list.\n",
    "The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we can create a list with the squares of the numbers from 1 to 10\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also create a list with the squares of the even numbers from 1 to 10\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Comprehensions can also be used to create dictionaries. For instance, we can create\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 11)}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we need to iterate over keys and values. This can also be done generating \n",
    "a list of tuples in-place. For instance, we can create a dictionary that maps letters\n",
    "to their position in the alphabet as follows:"
